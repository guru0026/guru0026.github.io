        <h2>Life of Patrick Star</h2>
        <p>Patrick is an anomaly; A starfish like no other. I've never been able to figure out how he manages to find space between his rock and the sand-bed. (Does the rock collapse in itself from the inside, or does the sand open up everytime he steps in?) Nor will I ever be able to figure out why he lives under a rock in the first place. I like to think that Patrick is an INF-J type of starfish, and that the rock which he calls his abode is his quiet place for self-reflection and meditation. He probably contemplates the meaning of life at the bottom of a bikini; with no fellow starfish and an annoying sponge for a friend. Yes, I think Patrick is having an existential crisis. The pessimistic squid would probably make for a better Kafka character, but let's just pretend that this enlightened starfish does something deeply profound under his rock. Because I cannot imagine him not doing anything... and I don't want to lose sleep over it.</p>

        <h3>Facts about Patrick</h3>
        <p>Based on my close observations of his character, the aura he emits and my amazing deductive abilities, I'm pretty sure that Patrick is:</p>
        <ol id="fact-list"></ol>
            <li>A Capricorn. But he could also be a Sag; Or maybe a Pisces. It's gotta be one of those three, but I would bet on Capricorn.</li>
            <li>Spirit-animal is probably something aquatic.</li>
            <li>Pink is clearly his color. Or maybe that's just what he's projecting because of a really bad sunburn, and his actual "favorite" color is a complete mystery.</li>
            <li>An "outdoor" sort-of starfish. He likes sandy beaches and shorts, and doesn't believe in shirts.</li>
            <li>Definitely a team-player; When he isn't busy being a loner.</li>
