        <h3>Facts about Patrick</h3>
        <p>Based on my close observations of his character, the aura he emits and my amazing deductive abilities, I'm pretty sure that Patrick is:</p>
        <ol id="fact-list"></ol>
            <li>a Capricorn. But he could also be a Sag; Or maybe a Pisces. It's gotta be one of those three, but I would bet on Capricorn.</li>
            <li>His spirit-animal is probably something aquatic.</li>
            <li>Pink is clearly his color. Or maybe that's just what he's projecting because of a really bad sunburn, and his actual "favorite" color is a complete mystery.</li>
            <li>He's an "outdoor" sort-of starfish. He likes sandy beaches and shorts, and doesn't believe in shirts.</li>
            <li>Definitely a team-player.</li>
