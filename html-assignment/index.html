            <p>I'm an architect from India with a fascination for all things creative. I'm into architecture, photography, digital art, graphic design, and a lot of music. I've picked up and left countless instruments, but the guitar has been a constant. One thing that I've realized after working for five years in the building industry is that, as creative professionals, just doing what we've been taught doesn't cut it. We must constantly <em>push our creative boundaries</em> to truly succeed. There is a quote that frames this idea perfectly.</p>
            <blockquote>
                Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist.
                <cite>- Pablo Picasso</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>If someone were to ask me about my background, I wouldn't know where to start. Although I'm Indian by descent, my background is as confusing as they get. I was born in Switzerland, grew up in Korea, the Czech Republic, India, the <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr>, and Uganda before going back to India to finish architecture school. After shifting and leaving it all behind (the house, the neighborhood, the friends, the identity I built) for the n<sup>th</sup> time I faced an identity crisis of sorts during my teen and early adult years. I used to feel embarrassed because I never really got the sense that I fit in anywhere, but with time, I realized that I actually belong to all the places that shaped me. I can proudly own <em>all of my experiences</em> and call <em>the world</em> my home.</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>It's hard to shortlist a set as my definitive hobbies since I've tried so many things and they keep changing every now and then. But if I had to choose, my top 5 constants would be:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reading</strong>: Mostly non-fiction</li>
                <li><strong>Music</strong>: A lot of listening, a little bit of playing</li>
                <li><strong>Watching shows and movies</strong>: Usually comedy and psychological thrillers</li>
                <li><strong>Photography</strong>: Especially architectural</li>
                <li><strong>Drawing</strong>: Always carry my sketchbook and fineliners with me</li>
            </ol>
