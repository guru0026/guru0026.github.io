            <p>I'm an architect from India with a fascination for all things creative. I'm into architecture, photography, digital art, graphic design, and a lot of music. I've picked up and left countless instruments, but the guitar has been a constant. I've even tried my hand at cooking, but that didn't turn out like I'd hoped. </p>
            <p>If someone were to ask me about my background, I wouldn't know where to start. Although I'm Indian by lineage, my background and upbringing is as confusing as they get. I was born in Switzerland, grew up in Korea, the Czech Republic, India, the US, and Uganda before going back to India to pursue my passion for design. I used to be embarrassed about my background because I felt like I never really belonged anywhere, but with age and time, I realized that I actually belonged to all the places that shaped me. I can proudly own all of my experiences and call the world my home.</p>
